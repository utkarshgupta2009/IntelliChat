# IntelliChat

Welcome to the Flutter AI Chatbot project! This project demonstrates the integration of ChatGPT, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, into a Flutter application to create an intelligent and conversational chatbot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- This project assumes basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/utkarshgupta2009/IntelliChat.git
   cd IntelliChat
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Create a new project on the [OpenAI platform]to obtain the API key for ChatGPT. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the `lib/constants.dart` file with your actual API key.

## Usage

Run the Flutter application on an emulator or a physical device:

```bash
flutter run
```

Explore the chatbot interface and start interacting with ChatGPT-powered conversations.
